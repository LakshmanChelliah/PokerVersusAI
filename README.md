# PokerVersusAI
This Python script implements a basic Texas Holdem Poker game where the user faces off against an AI opponent.

## How to Play
To play the game, simply run the poker.py file using Python 3 in the command line:
The game will then prompt you for input on each turn, asking you to choose between different actions such as calling, raising, or folding. The AI opponent will make its own decisions based on its own algorithm.

#D ependencies
The script uses the following Python packages:

- random for generating random numbers used in shuffling the deck of cards and making decisions
- time for simulating delays in the game
- termcolor for printing colored text to the command line for better visualization
You can install these packages using pip:



# Future Improvements
This script is just a basic implementation of Texas Holdem Poker and there is a lot of room for improvement. Here are some ideas for future enhancements:

Improve the AI algorithm to make it more challenging for the user
Add support for multiplayer games
Implement a betting system with chips or virtual currency
Add support for different game modes
Improve the user interface to make it more interactive and engaging
